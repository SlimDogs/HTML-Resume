This software is similar to a content management system, giving administrators the opportunity to create custom forms, visualizations and data views for their staff. My role in the team is as a frontend developer.<br><br>

					While working in agile Scrum based environment we are having two weeks long sprints with daily stand ups, weekly backlog estimations and new features releases in the end of the sprints. Every four sprints we have a regression sprints for bug fixing and new tech integration. Thanks to regression sprints I was able to direct the whole project towards Angular 2 version by introducing TypeScript into our stack.<br></br>

We are using SharePoint plugins as a way to insert bits of our main application into SharePoint pages. This involves working with SharePoint Restful APIs, developing cross domain solutions.<br><br>

					While working in co-operation with backend developer my main responsibility was development of We R Sports ecommerce page. It was a 100% custom website with our own backend and fresh new frontend. I did a lot of JavaScript programming to implement it as there were lots of features which coldn't be implemented in other way. I have used various jQuery plugins and plain JavaScript to implement such features as slideshows, 360 product previews and many others. As our backend was based on Symfony (PHP framework) which used TWIG as it's default templating system I had to adapt and learn it to support my backend collegue.
					<br><br>
					After finishing with the main ecommerce platform my responsibility was to convert it to a single page application and replace our default eBay store with it. I have done this by constructing my own custom JavaScript framework based on url "hash" change event. I worked with different kinds restful APIs such as eBay API, Amazon API, PaymentSence Api, Royal Mail Api and many others. Working on this single application project made me to develop a solid base on a crossdomain data transfer techniques.

					While not working with main ecommerce platform and eBay store I was responsible for newsletters creation and for implementing best SEO practices (such as Schema.org markups) in main ecommerce platform. It also inolved me into learning some things which are not development related, such as usage of Google AdWords and Google WebMaster tools.`,

					<br><br>
					It was a very enjoyable project to work on because it's foundation was AngularJs framework and application had a lot of features. Some of the features were very UI heavy. Working with such features enabled me to get known with all Angular benefits and flaws.
					One of the better examples of UI heavy feature was "Matrix" view. Users could create a matrix which axis contained hundred of thousands items and my task was to display these axis and all the intersections between them in one page having a seemless scrolling experience. I had to use lazy loading and virtual dom rendering approach to do this.
					<br><br>
					I have personally worked practically on every aspect of UI - from setting up the routing logic to tiny bits like custom form dropdown elements. I have written hundreds of AgularJs factories, services, directives and their controllers... I am familliar with all the problems which occurs when developing using AngularJs and the ways how to overcome them. The importance of not using watchers and two way binding even though using it would make developers life so much easier (sadly in cost of perormance).

					As our main product was very tied with Microsoft products such as Visio, SharePoint I had oppurtunity to do some work related to them. To be specific I was responsibile of SharePoint application development. SharePoint applications - it's parts of "Office Architect" which can be integrated into SharePoint pages. I learned a lot about SharePoint and cross domain communication while working on these apps. I used such techniques as jSONp for cross domain data transfering and PostMessage API for communication between apps which were located in different iframes / tabs.

					As the main frontend developer I had to take responsibility and care about the frontend devOps. Our development operations were such as SASS compilation, Babel/TypeScript compilation, file bundling and minification, unit test running and many others.

This core was made using plain JavaScript and jQuery. We were the first ones who introduced constantly updating data to the eBay listings, which enabled us to use unusual, our own features in eBay store and listings.
