					<p>
					I was one of the two dedicated front end developers. My responsibility was to develop and maintain frontend for main Application called “Office Architect” and its plugins which were integrated in Microsoft software peaces such as SharePoint, and some Office Suite applications. As “Office Architect” scale and became a huge application I learned the importance of the way how we bind data (bindonce!), best practices of data sharing between different parts of application, service/factories usage and unit testing.

					I worked on every aspect of UI from creating notifications to creating a very complex parts such as rendering visual matrixes which axis contained more than hundred thousand items (count the intersections…). It involved a lot of different techniques such as virtual DOM rendering to implement things like that.

					As most of the developers were much stronger in backend development but still worked with frontend (one of the Scrum goals) I learned to make components very generic and easy to use.

					I was also leading frontend DevOps such as unit testing, compilation for Typescript and Sass and many others auto tasks.

					One of my main responsibilities also was integrating new people into the project (to be specific the frontend part of it).

					As AngularJs 2 was releases one of our goals became to upgrade our core framework to this version, so one of my tasks was leading the transitioning. We started converting our logic to Typescript using best recommended practices.
