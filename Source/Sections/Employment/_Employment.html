					Orbus is a software company that provides enterprise architecture management software. My department is developing a brand new browser based solution with SharePoint and Visio integration. This software is similar to a content management system, giving administrators the opportunity to create custom forms, visualizations and data views for their staff. My role in the team is as a front-end developer.<br><br>

					While working in agile Scrum based environment we are having two week long sprints with daily stand ups, weekly backlog estimations and new features releases in the end of the sprints. Every four sprints we have a regression sprints for bug fixing and new tech integration. Thanks to regression sprints I was able to direct the whole main platform project towards Angular 2 version by introducing TypeScript into our tech stack.<br></br>

					I am also responsible for SharePoint plugins development which are almost entirely based on front-end code ("SharePoint hosted apps"). We are using SharePoint plugins as a way to insert bits of our main application into SharePoint pages. This involves working with SharePoint Restful APIs, developing cross domain solutions.<br><br>

					When I'm not developing I provide training and support for more juniour developers and take care of our front-end development operations.

					A family business which is selling sport related items online. Besides the main ecommerce website they have multiple stores in such selling channels like eBay, Amazon, Play.com
					<br><br>
					While working in co-operation with back-end developer my main responsibility was development of We R Sports ecommerce page. It was a 100% custom website with our own back-end and fresh new front-end. I did a lot of JavaScript programming to implement it as there were lots of features which couldn't be implemented in other way. I have used various jQuery plugins and plain JavaScript to implement such features as slideshows, 360 product previews and many others. As our back-end was based on Symfony (PHP framework) which used TWIG as it's default templating system I had to adapt and learn it to support my back-end collegue.
					<br><br>
					After finishing with the main ecommerce platform my responsibility was to convert it to a single page application and replace our default eBay store with it. I have done this by constructing my own custom JavaScript framework based on url "hash" change event. I worked with different kinds restful APIs such as eBay API, Amazon API, PaymentSence Api, Royal Mail Api and many others. Working on this single application project made me to develop a solid base on a crossdomain data transfer techniques.
					<br><br>
					While not working with main ecommerce platform and eBay store I was responsible for newsletters creation and for implementing best SEO practices (such as Schema.org markups) in main ecommerce platform. It also inolved me into learning some things which are not development related, such as usage of Google AdWords and Google WebMaster tools.

					While studying and not being able to have a permanent job I spend my weekends and holidays working on a freelance projects.
					<br><br>
					I worked on very different kinds of projects and costumer request tasks: varying from finding the web hosting solutions to developing a websites from stratch. While mostly using "ready to go" content management solutions such as WordPress, CuteNews and PhpNuke I also did a great amount of custom templating and plugin creation. At the time when "guest book" feature was trending I developed a PHP based guest book solution which was later installed and successfully used in multiple costumer websites.
					<br><br>
					Also worth to mention that I was developing PHPbb (discussion forums platform system) plugins.
