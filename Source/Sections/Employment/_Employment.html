						My main responsibility was frontend development for newest "Orbus Software" product called "Office Architect" (not official name as product is not released yet). It is a massive single page application which main purpose is Enterprise management.
						<br /><br />
						"Office Architect" frontend foundation was based on AngularJs framework which for me meant that every UI component had to be nicely tied with AngularJs life cycle. I have personally worked practically on every aspect of UI - from setting up the routing logic to tiny bits like custom form dropdown elements.
						<br /><br />
						It was a very enjoyable project to work on because it had a lot of features. Some of the features were very UI heavy. Working with such features enabled me to get known with all Angular benefits and flaws.
						One of the better examples were "Matrix" views. Application users could create a matrix which axis contained hundred of thousands items and my task was to display these axis and all the intersections between them in the page having a seemless scrolling experience. I had to use lazy loading and virtual dom rendering approach to do this, as both browsers and AngularJs couldn't handle such amounts of data.
						<br /><br />
						I have written hundreds of AgularJs factories, services, directives and their controllers, filters... I am familliar with all the problems which occurs when developing using AngularJs and the ways how to overcome them. The importance of not using watchers and two way binding even though using them would make developers life so much easier (sadly in cost of perormance).
						<br /><br />
						As our main product was very deeply connected with Microsoft products such as Visio, SharePoint I had oppurtunity to do some work related to them. To be specific I was responsibile of SharePoint application development. SharePoint applications - it's parts of "Office Architect" which can be integrated into SharePoint pages. I learned a lot about SharePoint and cross domain communication while working on these apps. I used such techniques as jSONp for cross domain data transfering and PostMessage API for communication between apps which were located in different iframes / tabs. A very unique and valuable experience!
						<br /><br />
						As the main frontend developer I had to take responsibility and care about the frontend devOps. Our development operations were such as SASS compilation, Babel/TypeScript compilation, file bundling and minification, unit test running and many others. Initially we used Grunt as a devOps task runner, but after some time I had oppurtunity to replace it with Gulp which is much more flexible.
						<br /><br />
						Besides all the development work I have done I did a lot of mentoring too! I was responsible for new people integration into our development process.</p>

						While working in this company my main responsibility was development and maintenance of their e-commerce web site.
						Once we finished the website I had to convert it to one page web application and adapt it on eBay to be used as store template/system.
						<br /><br />
						This was very interesting experience because it was my first step into one page application development plus adapting it on eBay with all the limitations was an interesting quest!
						<br /><br />
						I also started working on secondary project called “Oento” which was dedicated to  collect orders from different selling hubs such as Amazon, eBay, play.com and others. I did frontend work on the label print pages (my task was to enable ability to create a custom label, by dragging different components such as logo, address and other. I had to enable user placing them where he wants it to be. Also I had to make sure it’s being converted to .pdf files (yes we done all of it in frontend).
