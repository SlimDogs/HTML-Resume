			I build responsive, scalable web sites and web applications using a variety of technologies that work on smartphones, tablets and desktop computers.<br /><br />

			Starting with UI development, I became proficient in pure JavaScript as well as JavaScript frameworks like AngularJs. When I work my main goals always are to create beautiful and well performing frontend. Recent web applications I worked on was huge in size, so I have learned how important is to have well performing and fast frontend!
